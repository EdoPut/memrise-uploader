        <h2>How to use Memrise uploade</h2>
            <p>To use this add-on you just need to go to one of your courses database page and scroll till the bottom until yuo find a multiple input form with a button. Choose your file and click upload, Firefox could stops for some seconds but there's nothing wrong with that. </p>
        <h2>F.A.Q</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><e>Does this add-on upload all the files I'm throwing at it?</e><br>
            <p>No, it just search for those word without audio, the next version will let you choose to upload everything in addition.</p>
