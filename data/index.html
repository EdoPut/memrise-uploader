            <h2>How to use Memrise uploader</h2>
                <p>To use this add-on you just need to go to one of your courses database page and scroll till the bottom until you find a multiple input form with a button labeled "Upload".</p>
                <img src="img/multiple-button.png" alt="A image of the new form">
                <p>Choose your files and click upload, Firefox could stops for few seconds but there's nothing wrong with that.</p>
                <p>Firefox will fire a notification when files have been uploaded. Wait a few second and refresh the page to see your database populated.</p>
                <p><em>Only files that have the same name as the word will be uploaded, regardless of the word format.</em> E.g, fruit.mp3, FRUIT.mp3, FrUiT.mp3, fruit.0.mp3, fruit.another.mp3 will match the word fruit and Fruit.</p>

                <h2>F.A.Q</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Does this add-on upload all the files I'm throwing at it?</b><br>
                    <p>No, it just search for the words without audio, <span class="deleted">the next version will let you choose to upload everything instead</span> if you want to upload every file matching a word go to the addon's prefence page.</p></li>
                    <li><b>Why audio files doesn't appear immediately in the database page?</b><br><p>Every time a browser uploads a file to Memrise's server it receives a request to change the page appearence. I simply ignored this request because to me it was useless. Just refresh the page when you see the notification.</p></li>
